# CS255-System-analysis-and-design
The DriverPass client was a business who wanted to have a system that allowed users to sign-up for driver training online and also make appointments to physically drive.  DriverPass wanted to be able to have the owner to receive reports, the secretary to make appointments and the IT administrator make access changes to accounts depending on users and employees.  They also wanted it to be web-based, with the cloud handling their database and security.  I did particularly well with the diagrams I made showing how the business would allow users to sign-in, sign up for classes and the interface between the user, the web-application and the cloud.  There was a transcript I read and I made sure to take the client into effect, while also making sure that it would be suitable for the users.  I interpreted the user's need by trying to implement every system put in place, regardless of how likely or not it would function, such as having an API to a government body such as the DMV, which would be highly unlikely from a new company who is not yet trusted.  I approach designing software in a secure but functional way of helping the customer, but also helping them realize that not all aspects of the system are realistic, such as the DMV API aspect.  There are many things that can be implemented, but some take more time and have limitations.
